# About

Hi, I’m a French father of two, living in the suburbs of Paris. I’m curious by nature and passionate about many things — from technology and magic to science, philosophy, chess, and sports.

This space is just a small reflection of those interests. I try to learn, grow, and be a little better every day. Thanks for stopping by — feel free to look around and get in touch if something resonates.
